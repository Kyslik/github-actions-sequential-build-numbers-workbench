# github-actions-~sequential~-incremental-build-numbers-workbench

Workbench for testing alternative approaches to obtain ~sequential~ incremental (or semi-sequential) build numbers from GitHub Actions.

> **TLDR**: go with [`build-via-timestamp`](https://github.com/Kyslik/github-actions-sequential-build-numbers-workbench/blob/main/.github/workflows/various-build-numbers.yaml#L19-L35) - `date +%s%3N`.
